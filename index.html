  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>
    Hello World! My name is Vagner Ribas, I've been working with technology for over 10 years, but before that happened I've already done a few things. At age 15, 
    12/1997 to 12/1998, I had my first job as a packer at <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companhia_Zaffari" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zaffari</a>. I worked as an office boy, from 09/1999 to 01/2000, in an office where I did the accounting for 
    several day care centers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In my last job as an office boy, I worked at <a href="http://www.coreconrs.org.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CORECON/RS</a>, a local responsible for the records of economists and regularizing professionals. I worked for 10 years 
    and in 2010 I resigned as responsible for the registry sector.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2011 I started an internship as a Graphic Designer and Web Designer at the company <a href="https://db.tec.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBServer</a> in the marketing area. During this period, he had the first contact 
    with the technology area. Below is the list where I've been.
