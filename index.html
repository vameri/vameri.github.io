    Hello World! My name is Vagner Ribas, I've been working with technology for over 10 years, but before that happened I've already done a few things. At age 15, 
    12/1997 to 12/1998, I had my first job as a packer at Zaffari. I worked as an office boy, from 09/1999 to 01/2000, in an office where I did the accounting for 
    several day care centers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In my last job as an office boy, I worked at CORECON/RS, a local responsible for the records of economists and regularizing professionals. I worked for 10 years 
    and in 2010 I resigned as responsible for the registry sector.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2011 I started an internship as a Graphic Designer and Web Designer at the company DBServer in the marketing area. During this period, he had the first contact 
    with the technology area. Below is the list where I've been.
